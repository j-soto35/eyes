# Title: Eyes Exercise

# Description:
This project displays two eye balls on the screen created using CSS and HTML. Using,
JavaScript, the project listens to mouse events, which cause the eyes to follow your cursor 
around the screen.

# How to run:
1. Clone this repo onto your local machine
2. Locate the index.html file in your finder
3. Drag and drop the index.html file into a web browser

# Road map:
One possible improvement can be adding additional animations, such as a blink
when the user clicks the screen.
